LibEBA Embedable Bit Array

Toying with making an implementation suitable for small cpus.

This is just a learning exercise, although perhaps it may be useful.


Usage:

There is no magic to the 'eba_new' and 'eba_free', only convience.

In fact, there is not magic to the 'eba_set' or 'eba_get', rather they
simply make the indexing a bit in a byte array easier, as well as do the
bit-fiddling so I don't have to look it up or think hard.

If targeting something like an stm or avr chip, the source should be
easy to drop into a project, then modify to remove references to the C
standard library.
