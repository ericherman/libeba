* rework little endian shifting to not require bytes[] reversals
* consider a #define or typedef a type for eba_size_bits
  - size_t is the longest an array can be, and can be smaller than uint32_t
  - however the number of bits = (size_bytes * CHAR_BIT)
  - if a the embedded machine has size_t of 2^16, and we have 2^10 of that
    in a giant bit field, then size_bits will be 2^18 (larger than size_t)
